    "- Quick sorting is advantageous because it does not necessitate a lot of extra space because quicksort uses main memory, whereas merge sort requires extra memory(auxiliary memory) to perform the same task. \n",
    "- Quicksort outruns Mergesort in terms of speed because the results of quicksort are relatively close to each other in the cache, so it is much faster than merge sort.\n",

    "- When it comes to memory regions that can be used repeatedly, Quick sort outperforms Merge sort. \n",
    "- Locality of reference, i.e. a processor's proclivity to repeatedly access the same memory regions in a short amount of time is good when using quicksort unlike mergesort. \n",
    "### For sorting a linked list of elements Merge sort should be used over Quick sort for the following reasons:\n",
    "- It runs in O(nlogn) time even in the worst case,on the contrary quick sort runs in O(n2) in worst case. \n",

    "- It doesn't need a lot of extra memory, de-facto it uses a constant amount of auxilary memory while computing linked list and quicksorts in-place memory usage doesn't count as an advantage for this case.\n",
